## Setup

Host

1. Download the index.php file.
2. Add to your /var/www/html folder

*Tip: Make a new folder called 'xss' eg: /var/www/html/xss*

3. Run the php local server or xampp

*If you have xampp installed use that instead of the php server. (htdocs)


*Have php installed so you can use php in terminal, then start a local server*

```
php -S 127.0.0.1:8000
```

4. Visit the page at http://127.0.0.1:8000/xss/index.php and start testing!
