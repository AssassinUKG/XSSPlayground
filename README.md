## Setup

Host
Download the inxed.php file and add to your /var/www/html folder,
*Tip: Make a new folder called 'xss' eg: /var/www/html/xss

* Have php installed so you can use php in terminal, then start a local server
```
php -S 127.0.0.1:8000
```
After the server is started, visit the page at http://127.0.0.1:8000/xss/index.php and start testing!
